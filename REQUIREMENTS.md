## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The Image Metadata Tool is a web-based application designed to analyze images using AI technology and extract meaningful metadata. It uses OpenAI's GPT Vision API to generate descriptive information about images and exports this data in CSV format.

### 1.2 Scope
The application provides a user interface for uploading multiple images, analyzing them using AI, and exporting the analysis results in a structured format.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Image Upload
- Support multiple image file uploads simultaneously
- Accept common image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- Provide visual feedback during upload process
- Validate file types and sizes before upload

### 2.2 Image Analysis
- Integrate with OpenAI's GPT Vision API
- Generate the following metadata for each image:
  - Title (max 70 characters)
  - Description (max 200 characters)
  - Keywords (comma-separated)
- Process multiple images in sequence
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Display analysis progress

### 2.3 Results Management
- Display analysis results in real-time
- Show the following for each image:
  - Original filename
  - Generated title
  - Generated description
  - Generated keywords
- Indicate success/failure status for each image
- Allow export of results to CSV format

### 2.4 CSV Export
- Export all successful analysis results to CSV
- CSV format should include:
  - Filename
  - Title
  - Description
  - Keywords
- Properly handle special characters and CSV formatting
- Generate timestamped filenames for exports

### 2.5 API Key Management
- Allow users to input their OpenAI API key
- Secure storage of API key during session
- Validate API key format
- Handle API authentication errors

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- Process multiple images efficiently

- Optimize image handling for API requests
- Handle large batches of images without crashing

### 3.2 Security
- Secure handling of API keys
- Client-side image processing
- No permanent storage of sensitive data
- Secure data transmission

### 3.3 Usability
- Clean, intuitive user interface
- Clear error messages
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### 3.4 Reliability
- Graceful error handling
- Recovery from API failures
- Data validation at all steps
- No data loss during export
